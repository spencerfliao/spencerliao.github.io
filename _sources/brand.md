# Brand Linguistic Insights & Research

A selection of anonymized deliverables from my time at Labbrand, where I conducted multilingual brand naming evaluations across markets.
* Designed and executed quantitative + qualitative studies with consumer groups.
* Analyzed pronunciation ease, phonetic associations, sentiment, and cultural relevance using statistical methods.
* Built visual dashboards (radar charts, phonetic maps, heat tables) to synthesize data into actionable naming recommendations.
* Presented findings to senior stakeholders to guide brand identity decisions in global product launches.
