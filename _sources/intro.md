# Welcome to my Project Collection

Hi, I'm Spencer Liao â€” a graduate student in Computational Linguistics and an aspiring Data Scientist. Here is a curated collection of work that reflects my technical journey and learning experiences.

This site features a range of projects across data science and machine learning. Each one includes context, methodology, and key outcomes to provide a clear picture of the problem-solving process behind it.

You can explore the full source code and documentation on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/spencerfliao?tab=repositories).
