# Design Training & Portfolio

Before pursuing consulting work and data science, I was formally trained as a designer at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), where I developed a strong foundation in creative thinking and problem-solving, visual communication, user experience, cross-disciplinary collaboration.
This body of work spans narrative-driven concepts, speculative design, product fabrication and branding, emphasizing the ability to move from abstract ideas to tangible outcomes.
